# PIC ADC
## Description
In this project, a three-dimensional scanner is made, which using a PIC18F4550 microcontroller and its internal ADC module and SHARP infrared sensors, measurements are made of a three-dimensional object rotated by a stepper motor. At the end of the object scan, its volume is shown on four seven-segment displays, determining a maximum volume of four figures.
